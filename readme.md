# Multiagent assignment - Representation and Iteraction 20/21

Content developed by Pablo Lanillos. Assistant Professor in Cognitive Artificial Intelligence. AI Department. Radboud University

### Prerequisites

- python 3 or superior
- jupyter notebook

## Getting Started

0. Install python 3 and jupyter notebook

Windows> https://medium.com/@kswalawage/install-python-and-jupyter-notebook-to-windows-10-64-bit-66db782e1d02
Linux> https://jupyter.org/install (better use pip)

- Create a virtual environment to setup and install your system with the name multiagent
- Activate the virtual environment

1. (Optional) Python basics - Good if you are not familiar with python
Open 0_python_numpy_basics.ipynb in the jupyter notebook and 

```
(multiagent) path_of_the_script >  jupyter notebook

```

Click on the script 0_python_numpy_basics.ipynb and complete the tasks

2. Open multiagent_assignment_part1.ipynb and complete the tasks

3. Open multiagent_assignment_part2.ipynb and follow the instructions

You need to program a python script with the code.


## Submission

1. Submit the following python code Name_Surname_multiagent_RI_2021.py:

A variable in the beginning of the code defines one of the following behaviours:
   - exercise = 1 - Multiagent search greedy 1 step discrete no communication.
   - exercise = 2 - Multiagent search greedy 1 step discrete common belief.
   - exercise = 3 - Multiagent search n-step continuous centralized optimization.

2. Submit the report in pdf. A description of the report can be found in the report_template.pdf

### Remark: You have learned to code a state-of-the-art algorithm for multiagents systems in the presence of uncertainty. Several applications can be faced: Search and Rescue, Monitoring, Service robotics, etc.

Hope you enjoyed the assignment. Pablo Lanillos. Representation & Interaction 2021
